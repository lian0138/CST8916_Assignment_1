## Introduction

"POT" (平安通) is a health monitoring project that's a joint project between the Macau government and CTM (Companhia de Telecomunicações de Macau), my previous employer. I was part of the development team, working on making this system help keep the elderly in Macau safe and healthy. We use wearable tech to keep an eye on their health in real time.

## Section 1: REST and GraphQL for Data Requests and Updates
### REST for Data Requests and Updates

In the POT, we use a REST API to handle data requests and updates between the management front-end and our microservices. Here are the main endpoints:  
[Generated by AI because the actual APIs belong to my previous company and cannot be disclosed.]

* GET /users/{id}
Fetches a user's info, including their health metrics and history.
* POST /users
Adds a new user when they start using the health monitor.
* PUT /users/{id}
Updates a user's health data based on new information from their wearable device.
* DELETE /users/{id}
Removes a user from the system if they stop using the device or pass away.

Using a REST API for managing data in the POT provides a straightforward and reliable way to handle user information and health metrics. It connects our front-end to the microservices efficiently, ensures the system can grow, and keeps data secure. This setup helps us deliver effective and real-time health monitoring for elderly users.

### GraphQL for Data Requests and Updates

Although we're currently using REST APIs, let's explore how **GraphQL** could enhance the **POT** health monitoring system for managing data requests and updates. With **GraphQL**, we can create a more flexible and efficient data retrieval system. Here's how it might look:  
[Generated by AI because the actual data structure belong to my previous company and cannot be disclosed.]
- **Queries**:
  - **Get User Information**:
    ```graphql
    query {
      user(id: "123") {
        id
        name
        healthMetrics {
          heartRate
          bloodPressure
          lastUpdated
        }
      }
    }
    ```

- **Mutations**:
  - **Add New User**:
    ```graphql
    mutation {
      addUser(name: "John Doe", age: 70) {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    ```

  - **Update Health Data**:
    ```graphql
    mutation {
      updateHealthMetrics(id: "123", heartRate: 72, bloodPressure: "120/80") {
        id
        healthMetrics {
          heartRate
          bloodPressure
          lastUpdated
        }
      }
    }
    ```

  - **Delete User**:
    ```graphql
    mutation {
      deleteUser(id: "123") {
        id
        name
      }
    }
    ```

While we're currently leveraging REST APIs for the **POT** , integrating **GraphQL** could offer greater flexibility and efficiency in data management. It allows for more precise data fetching, reduces the number of requests, and can enhance the overall developer experience. However, it's essential to weigh these benefits against the added complexity and ensure it aligns with our project's needs.


### REST vs. GraphQL: Quick Comparison  
[We firstly list the points and AI help to format it and make into a table]
| **Aspect** | **REST** | **GraphQL** |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **Pros**   | 1. **Simplicity:** Easy to understand and implement.<br>2. **Wide Adoption:** Lots of tools and community support. | 1. **Flexible Queries:** Fetch exactly the data you need.<br>2. **Single Endpoint:** Simplifies API management. |
| **Con**    | **Over-fetching/Under-fetching:** Can retrieve too much or too little data. | **Complexity:** Harder to set up and learn compared to REST. |

### **Conclusion**  
[We firstly list the points and AI help to make the conclusion smoothly]
Both REST and GraphQL have their strengths. **REST** is great for straightforward applications with well-defined data needs, benefiting from its simplicity and extensive support. **GraphQL**, on the other hand, shines when you require flexible data retrieval and more efficient communication between client and server. Choose the one that best fits your project's complexity and requirements.


## Section 2: WebSockets for Real-time Communication

### How We Use WebSockets

In our **POT (平安通)**, we use **WebSockets** to handle real-time data between wearable devices and our system.

- **Data Sync:** 
  - **Every Minute:** Wearables like smartwatches send health data to the system every minute.
  
- **Instant Alerts:**
  - **Abnormal Data:** If the device detects something unusual, it sends an alert right away.
  - **Emergency Response:** Our government monitoring center receives the alert and contacts emergency services immediately.

### WebSockets vs. REST and GraphQL  
[We firstly list the points and AI help to format it and make into a table]
| **Feature**       | **WebSockets**                          | **REST**                      | **GraphQL**                  |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Real-time**     | Yes, keeps a constant connection        | No, needs polling              | No, same as REST              |
| **Communication** | Two-way, both client and server can send data | One-way, client requests data | One-way, client requests data |
| **Best For**      | Live updates and alerts                 | Standard data operations      | Flexible data queries        |

### Conclusion

WebSockets are essential for real-time communication in the POT application, allowing immediate updates and alerts that enhance health monitoring for elderly users. Unlike REST and GraphQL, WebSockets support a persistent connection and bidirectional data flow, making them suitable for applications that require instant communication and quick interventions.
